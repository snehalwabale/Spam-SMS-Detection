# Spam-SMS-Detection

Developed a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (legitimate) using a dataset of 5,577 tagged messages. The project involved preprocessing the text data, implementing and training algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM, and achieving high accuracy in spam detection. Utilized Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK to create a scalable solution for filtering unwanted messages.
